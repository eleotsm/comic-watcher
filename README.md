Do you want to received a notification in your gmail every time your favorite comic has been updated?

This code is for you! You can of course change it to fit your qualifications.

I used Jsoup, opensource that parses a website | https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/

You need Java 8 or above and to generate your *own password in gmail for this project in order to receive a notification in your email.*

Enjoy!
